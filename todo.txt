Story:
Father: "I got a message back from Arima saying he would accept you as his student. I've taught you everything I can, and it's time for you to go out and see the world. I was planning on taking you to Arima myself, but I'm too sick to stand."
Son: "Father...it's okay! I can do this."
Father: "I know you can, but...it's dangerous to go alone. Take this!"

* gives ring of protection *

Father: "This is the ring of protection I forged when my master deemed me ready, so many years ago. I've poured energy into it every day, but if you're not careful, the spirits outside will drain it quickly. If you're in extreme danger, <press space> to hurt the spirits. Be warned - there's too many of them for you to get through the forest that way. Now, go. Once night falls, you'll have no chance."

Son: "Goodbye, Father."
Father: "Goodbye, my dear son."

* You got the ring! *

Mechanics:
- Ring provides a passive aura
  - If a spirit touches the aura, they are turned to 'flee' (like Pacman ghosts) for a period of time, and the ring loses 1 point.
  - If you press space, the aura surges, and banishes any spirit it touches. The ring loses 10 points (or more?).
- If the ring loses all energy, you have 3 hit points then you die.
- 'oases' in the forest provide a place to recharge your ring, at the cost of spending time.
